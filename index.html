        <p>Cambridge Transcriptions™ was founded in 1989, with the aim of gathering together the most skilled professionals and the most up-to-date technology in the industry. From its roots as a small office start-up, this American Transmedia® company has grown into an established and respected presence in the recording, reporting, and transcription community, where it is now based out of Central Square offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>After two decades and several technological generations, Cambridge Transcriptions™ remains committed to the same ideals that inspired its creation: quality, reliability, and personal attention to every client. More than anything, our success is due to the talents and expertise of our hardworking staff. Former staff members have later gone on to earn Ph.D.s and master’s degrees from such institutions as Stanford and Harvard, as well as positions in companies ranging from inner-city nonprofits to business development firms. Our current team meets the same standards of intelligence, integrity, and attention to detail, and you will always know that your project is in good hands.</p>
